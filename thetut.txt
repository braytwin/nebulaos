The first PhoneVM on the Laptop!
Here are the needs and wants I want on NebulaOS

◊Ç‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ THEME

- The theme is a black and dark grey gradient website with some hints of white in the color.
- The particles are smooth to the right, moving white particles.
- The font of the website is League Spartan for the big titles, and Inter Bold for the small texts.
- The main colors are Black, White, and Baby Blue.
- There are smooth animations for everything, smooth effects, and gradient colors.
- The icons are not emojis. They are white "Font Awesome" Icons and not slanted.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

◊Ç‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ WHAT THE WEBSITE IS

- The website is a Virtual Machine for these phones: iPhone, Android, and Nokia. (iPhone 16/17 (With liquid glass) + Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy (For Android), and any Nokia.)
- The website will have a homepage saying what the website is, the plan, and other stuff. There is a button labeled "Explore," which takes you to a page where you can select the model of the phone you want to simulate for the VM. It features the iPhone button (with Font Awesome Icons), followed by the Android and Nokia logos, and then the models. 
- The features on the website are that it runs on the Scramjet Proxy in the /scram folder in /scram/scramjet.all.js or something with the sw.js and stuff, and it proxies the link for whatever app/game you are doing. If you are running on the Google Pixel model and you use Notepad, it will proxyfy the link for https://keep.google.com/ and do the /scram link for it. I don't know how to do that, so could you explain? The apps always have proxied links and such.
- The phone the user selected will match the phone they did. And there is on the Github Repo a folder for /phones/(AnyModel)iphone/iphone16/ or whatever they did, then that frames into the phone model or the shape of that phone.

◊Ç‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ PHONE APPS

Notification
Limited availability
Secure context: This feature is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), in some or all supporting browsers.

Note: This feature is available in Web Workers.

The Notification interface of the Notifications API is used to configure and display desktop notifications to the user.

These notifications' appearance and specific functionality vary across platforms but generally they provide a way to asynchronously provide information to the user.

Constructor
Notification()
Creates a new instance of the Notification object.

Static properties
Also inherits properties from its parent interface, EventTarget.

Notification.permission Read only
A string representing the current permission to display notifications. Possible values are:

denied ‚Äî The user refuses to have notifications displayed.
granted ‚Äî The user accepts having notifications displayed.
default ‚Äî The user choice is unknown and therefore the browser will act as if the value were denied.
Notification.maxActions Read only Experimental
The maximum number of actions supported by the device and the User Agent.

Instance properties
Also inherits properties from its parent interface, EventTarget.

Notification.actions Read only Experimental
The actions array of the notification as specified in the constructor's options parameter.

Notification.badge Read only
A string containing the URL of an image to represent the notification when there is not enough space to display the notification itself such as for example, the Android Notification Bar. On Android devices, the badge should accommodate devices up to 4x resolution, about 96 by 96 px, and the image will be automatically masked.

Notification.body Read only
The body string of the notification as specified in the constructor's options parameter.

Notification.data Read only
Returns a structured clone of the notification's data.

Notification.dir Read only
The text direction of the notification as specified in the constructor's options parameter.

Notification.icon Read only
The URL of the image used as an icon of the notification as specified in the constructor's options parameter.

Notification.image Read only Experimental
The URL of an image to be displayed as part of the notification, as specified in the constructor's options parameter.

Notification.lang Read only
The language code of the notification as specified in the constructor's options parameter.

Notification.renotify Read only Experimental
Specifies whether the user should be notified after a new notification replaces an old one.

Notification.requireInteraction Read only
A boolean value indicating that a notification should remain active until the user clicks or dismisses it, rather than closing automatically.

Notification.silent Read only
Specifies whether the notification should be silent ‚Äî i.e., no sounds or vibrations should be issued regardless of the device settings.

Notification.tag Read only
The ID of the notification (if any) as specified in the constructor's options parameter.

Notification.timestamp Read only Experimental
Specifies the time at which a notification is created or applicable (past, present, or future).

Notification.title Read only
The title of the notification as specified in the first parameter of the constructor.

Notification.vibrate Read only Experimental
Specifies a vibration pattern for devices with vibration hardware to emit.

Static methods
Also inherits methods from its parent interface, EventTarget.

Notification.requestPermission()
Requests permission from the user to display notifications.

Instance methods
Also inherits methods from its parent interface, EventTarget.

Notification.close()
Programmatically closes a notification instance.

Events
Also inherits events from its parent interface, EventTarget.

click
Fires when the user clicks the notification.

close
Fires when the user closes the notification.

error
Fires when the notification encounters an error.

show
Fires when the notification is displayed.

Examples
Assume this basic HTML:

html

Copy
<button>Notify me!</button>
It's possible to send a notification as follows ‚Äî here we present a fairly verbose and complete set of code you could use if you wanted to first check whether notifications are supported, then check if permission has been granted for the current origin to send notifications, then request permission if required, before then sending a notification.

js

Copy
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", notifyMe);

function notifyMe() {
  if (!("Notification" in window)) {
    // Check if the browser supports notifications
    alert("This browser does not support desktop notification");
  } else if (Notification.permission === "granted") {
    // Check whether notification permissions have already been granted;
    // if so, create a notification
    const notification = new Notification("Hi there!");
    // ‚Ä¶
  } else if (Notification.permission !== "denied") {
    // We need to ask the user for permission
    Notification.requestPermission().then((permission) => {
      // If the user accepts, let's create a notification
      if (permission === "granted") {
        const notification = new Notification("Hi there!");
        // ‚Ä¶
      }
    });
  }

  // At last, if the user has denied notifications, and you
  // want to be respectful there is no need to bother them anymore.
}
We no longer show a live sample on this page, as Chrome and Firefox no longer allow notification permissions to be requested from cross-origin <iframe>s, with other browsers to follow. To see an example in action, check out our To-do list example (also see the app running live).

Note: In the above example we spawn notifications in response to a user gesture (clicking a button). This is not only best practice ‚Äî you should not be spamming users with notifications they didn't agree to ‚Äî but going forward browsers will explicitly disallow notifications not triggered in response to a user gesture. Firefox is already doing this from version 72, for example.

Map
The central class of the API ‚Äî it is used to create a map on a page and manipulate it.

Usage example
// initialize the map on the "map" div with a given center and zoom
var map = L.map('map', {
    center: [51.505, -0.09],
    zoom: 13
});
Creation
Factory	Description
L.map(<String> id, <Map options> options?)	Instantiates a map object given the DOM ID of a <div> element and optionally an object literal with Map options.
L.map(<HTMLElement> el, <Map options> options?)	Instantiates a map object given an instance of a <div> HTML element and optionally an object literal with Map options.
Options
Option	Type	Default	Description
preferCanvas	Boolean	false	Whether Paths should be rendered on a Canvas renderer. By default, all Paths are rendered in a SVG renderer.
Control options
Option	Type	Default	Description
attributionControl	Boolean	true	Whether a attribution control is added to the map by default.
zoomControl	Boolean	true	Whether a zoom control is added to the map by default.
Interaction Options
Option	Type	Default	Description
closePopupOnClick	Boolean	true	Set it to false if you don't want popups to close when user clicks the map.
boxZoom	Boolean	true	Whether the map can be zoomed to a rectangular area specified by dragging the mouse while pressing the shift key.
doubleClickZoom	Boolean|String	true	Whether the map can be zoomed in by double clicking on it and zoomed out by double clicking while holding shift. If passed 'center', double-click zoom will zoom to the center of the view regardless of where the mouse was.
dragging	Boolean	true	Whether the map is draggable with mouse/touch or not.
zoomSnap	Number	1	Forces the map's zoom level to always be a multiple of this, particularly right after a fitBounds() or a pinch-zoom. By default, the zoom level snaps to the nearest integer; lower values (e.g. 0.5 or 0.1) allow for greater granularity. A value of 0 means the zoom level will not be snapped after fitBounds or a pinch-zoom.
zoomDelta	Number	1	Controls how much the map's zoom level will change after a zoomIn(), zoomOut(), pressing + or - on the keyboard, or using the zoom controls. Values smaller than 1 (e.g. 0.5) allow for greater granularity.
trackResize	Boolean	true	Whether the map automatically handles browser window resize to update itself.
Panning Inertia Options
Option	Type	Default	Description
inertia	Boolean	*	If enabled, panning of the map will have an inertia effect where the map builds momentum while dragging and continues moving in the same direction for some time. Feels especially nice on touch devices. Enabled by default.
inertiaDeceleration	Number	3000	The rate with which the inertial movement slows down, in pixels/second¬≤.
inertiaMaxSpeed	Number	Infinity	Max speed of the inertial movement, in pixels/second.
easeLinearity	Number	0.2	
worldCopyJump	Boolean	false	With this option enabled, the map tracks when you pan to another "copy" of the world and seamlessly jumps to the original one so that all overlays like markers and vector layers are still visible.
maxBoundsViscosity	Number	0.0	If maxBounds is set, this option will control how solid the bounds are when dragging the map around. The default value of 0.0 allows the user to drag outside the bounds at normal speed, higher values will slow down map dragging outside bounds, and 1.0 makes the bounds fully solid, preventing the user from dragging outside the bounds.
Keyboard Navigation Options
Option	Type	Default	Description
keyboard	Boolean	true	Makes the map focusable and allows users to navigate the map with keyboard arrows and +/- keys.
keyboardPanDelta	Number	80	Amount of pixels to pan when pressing an arrow key.
Mouse wheel options
Option	Type	Default	Description
scrollWheelZoom	Boolean|String	true	Whether the map can be zoomed by using the mouse wheel. If passed 'center', it will zoom to the center of the view regardless of where the mouse was.
wheelDebounceTime	Number	40	Limits the rate at which a wheel can fire (in milliseconds). By default user can't zoom via wheel more often than once per 40 ms.
wheelPxPerZoomLevel	Number	60	How many scroll pixels (as reported by L.DomEvent.getWheelDelta) mean a change of one full zoom level. Smaller values will make wheel-zooming faster (and vice versa).
Touch interaction options
Option	Type	Default	Description
tapHold	Boolean		Enables simulation of contextmenu event, default is true for mobile Safari.
tapTolerance	Number	15	The max number of pixels a user can shift his finger during touch for it to be considered a valid tap.
touchZoom	Boolean|String	*	Whether the map can be zoomed by touch-dragging with two fingers. If passed 'center', it will zoom to the center of the view regardless of where the touch events (fingers) were. Enabled for touch-capable web browsers.
bounceAtZoomLimits	Boolean	true	Set it to false if you don't want the map to zoom beyond min/max zoom and then bounce back when pinch-zooming.
Map State Options
Option	Type	Default	Description
crs	CRS	L.CRS.EPSG3857	The Coordinate Reference System to use. Don't change this if you're not sure what it means.
center	LatLng	undefined	Initial geographic center of the map
zoom	Number	undefined	Initial map zoom level
minZoom	Number	*	Minimum zoom level of the map. If not specified and at least one GridLayer or TileLayer is in the map, the lowest of their minZoom options will be used instead.
maxZoom	Number	*	Maximum zoom level of the map. If not specified and at least one GridLayer or TileLayer is in the map, the highest of their maxZoom options will be used instead.
layers	Layer[]	[]	Array of layers that will be added to the map initially
maxBounds	LatLngBounds	null	When this option is set, the map restricts the view to the given geographical bounds, bouncing the user back if the user tries to pan outside the view. To set the restriction dynamically, use setMaxBounds method.
renderer	Renderer	*	The default method for drawing vector layers on the map. L.SVG or L.Canvas by default depending on browser support.
Animation Options
Option	Type	Default	Description
zoomAnimation	Boolean	true	Whether the map zoom animation is enabled. By default it's enabled in all browsers that support CSS3 Transitions except Android.
zoomAnimationThreshold	Number	4	Won't animate zoom if the zoom difference exceeds this value.
fadeAnimation	Boolean	true	Whether the tile fade animation is enabled. By default it's enabled in all browsers that support CSS3 Transitions except Android.
markerZoomAnimation	Boolean	true	Whether markers animate their zoom with the zoom animation, if disabled they will disappear for the length of the animation. By default it's enabled in all browsers that support CSS3 Transitions except Android.
transform3DLimit	Number	2^23	Defines the maximum size of a CSS translation transform. The default value should not be changed unless a web browser positions layers in the wrong place after doing a large panBy.

Popup
Used to open popups in certain places of the map. Use Map.openPopup to open popups while making sure that only one popup is open at one time (recommended for usability), or use Map.addLayer to open as many as you want.

Usage example
If you want to just bind a popup to marker click and then open it, it's really easy:

marker.bindPopup(popupContent).openPopup();
Path overlays like polylines also have a bindPopup method.

A popup can be also standalone:

var popup = L.popup()
    .setLatLng(latlng)
    .setContent('<p>Hello world!<br />This is a nice popup.</p>')
    .openOn(map);
or

var popup = L.popup(latlng, {content: '<p>Hello world!<br />This is a nice popup.</p>'})
    .openOn(map);
Creation
Factory	Description
L.popup(<Popup options> options?, <Layer> source?)	Instantiates a Popup object given an optional options object that describes its appearance and location and an optional source object that is used to tag the popup with a reference to the Layer to which it refers.

Tooltip
Used to display small texts on top of map layers.

Usage example
If you want to just bind a tooltip to marker:

marker.bindTooltip("my tooltip text").openTooltip();
Path overlays like polylines also have a bindTooltip method.

A tooltip can be also standalone:

var tooltip = L.tooltip()
    .setLatLng(latlng)
    .setContent('Hello world!<br />This is a nice tooltip.')
    .addTo(map);
or

var tooltip = L.tooltip(latlng, {content: 'Hello world!<br />This is a nice tooltip.'})
    .addTo(map);
Note about tooltip offset. Leaflet takes two options in consideration for computing tooltip offsetting:

the offset Tooltip option: it defaults to [0, 0], and it's specific to one tooltip. Add a positive x offset to move the tooltip to the right, and a positive y offset to move it to the bottom. Negatives will move to the left and top.
the tooltipAnchor Icon option: this will only be considered for Marker. You should adapt this value if you use a custom icon.

TileLayer
Used to load and display tile layers on the map. Note that most tile servers require attribution, which you can set under Layer. Extends GridLayer.

Usage example
L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?{foo}', {foo: 'bar', attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'}).addTo(map);
URL template
A string of the following form:

'https://{s}.somedomain.com/blabla/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png'
{s} means one of the available subdomains (used sequentially to help with browser parallel requests per domain limitation; subdomain values are specified in options; a, b or c by default, can be omitted), {z} ‚Äî zoom level, {x} and {y} ‚Äî tile coordinates. {r} can be used to add "@2x" to the URL to load retina tiles.

You can use custom keys in the template, which will be evaluated from TileLayer options, like this:

L.tileLayer('https://{s}.somedomain.com/{foo}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {foo: 'bar'});

Polygon
A class for drawing polygon overlays on a map. Extends Polyline.

Note that points you pass when creating a polygon shouldn't have an additional last point equal to the first one ‚Äî it's better to filter out such points.

Usage example
// create a red polygon from an array of LatLng points
var latlngs = [[37, -109.05],[41, -109.03],[41, -102.05],[37, -102.04]];

// zoom the map to the polygon
map.fitBounds(polygon.getBounds());
You can also pass an array of arrays of latlngs, with the first array representing the outer shape and the other arrays representing holes in the outer shape:

var latlngs = [
  [[37, -109.05],[41, -109.03],[41, -102.05],[37, -102.04]], // outer ring
  [[37.29, -108.58],[40.71, -108.58],[40.71, -102.50],[37.29, -102.50]] // hole
];
Additionally, you can pass a multi-dimensional array to represent a MultiPolygon shape.

var latlngs = [
  [ // first polygon

SVG
Allows vector layers to be displayed with SVG. Inherits Renderer.

Due to technical limitations, SVG is not available in all web browsers, notably Android 2.x and 3.x.

Although SVG is not available on IE7 and IE8, these browsers support VML (a now deprecated technology), and the SVG renderer will fall back to VML in this case.

VML was deprecated in 2012, which means VML functionality exists only for backwards compatibility with old versions of Internet Explorer.

Usage example
Use SVG by default for all paths in the map:

var map = L.map('map', {
    renderer: L.svg()
});
Use a SVG renderer with extra padding for specific vector geometries:

var map = L.map('map');
var myRenderer = L.svg({ padding: 0.5 });
var line = L.polyline( coordinates, { renderer: myRenderer } );
var circle = L.circle( center, { renderer: myRenderer } );

Functions
There are several static functions which can be called without instantiating L.SVG:
Function	Returns	Description
create(<String> name)	SVGElement	Returns a instance of SVGElement, corresponding to the class name passed. For example, using 'line' will return an instance of SVGLineElement.
pointsToPath(<Point[]> rings, <Boolean> closed)	String	Generates a SVG path string for multiple rings, with each ring turning into "M..L..L.." instructions
Canvas
Allows vector layers to be displayed with <canvas>. Inherits Renderer.

Due to technical limitations, Canvas is not available in all web browsers, notably IE8, and overlapping geometries might not display properly in some edge cases.

Usage example
Use Canvas by default for all paths in the map:

var map = L.map('map', {
    renderer: L.canvas()
});
Use a Canvas renderer with extra padding for specific vector geometries:

var map = L.map('map');
var myRenderer = L.canvas({ padding: 0.5 });
var line = L.polyline( coordinates, { renderer: myRenderer } );
var circle = L.circle( center, { renderer: myRenderer } );

FeatureGroup
Extended LayerGroup that makes it easier to do the same thing to all its member layers:

bindPopup binds a popup to all of the layers at once (likewise with bindTooltip)
Events are propagated to the FeatureGroup, so if the group has an event handler, it will handle events from any of the layers. This includes mouse events and custom events.
Has layeradd and layerremove events

GeoJSON
Represents a GeoJSON object or an array of GeoJSON objects. Allows you to parse GeoJSON data and display it on the map. Extends FeatureGroup.

Usage example
L.geoJSON(data, {
    style: function (feature) {
        return {color: feature.properties.color};
    }
}).bindPopup(function (layer) {

Creation
Factory	Description
L.geoJSON(<Object> geojson?, <GeoJSON options> options?)	Creates a GeoJSON layer. Optionally accepts an object in GeoJSON format to display on the map (you can alternatively add it later with addData method) and an options object.
Options
Option	Type	Default	Description
pointToLayer	Function	*	A Function defining how GeoJSON points spawn Leaflet layers. It is internally called when data is added, passing the GeoJSON point feature and its LatLng. The default is to spawn a default Marker:
function(geoJsonPoint, latlng) {
    return L.marker(latlng);
}
style	Function	*	A Function defining the Path options for styling GeoJSON lines and polygons, called internally when data is added. The default value is to not override any defaults:
function (geoJsonFeature) {
    return {}
}
onEachFeature	Function	*	A Function that will be called once for each created Feature, after it has been created and styled. Useful for attaching events and popups to features. The default is to do nothing with the newly created layers:
function (feature, layer) {}
filter	Function	*	A Function that will be used to decide whether to include a feature or not. The default is to include all features:
function (geoJsonFeature) {
    return true;
}
Note: dynamically changing the filter option will have effect only on newly added data. It will not re-evaluate already included features.

coordsToLatLng	Function	*	A Function that will be used for converting GeoJSON coordinates to LatLngs. The default is the coordsToLatLng static method.
markersInheritOptions	Boolean	false	Whether default Markers for "Point" type Features inherit from group options.

Functions
There are several static functions which can be called without instantiating L.GeoJSON:
Function	Returns	Description
geometryToLayer(<Object> featureData, <GeoJSON options> options?)	Layer	Creates a Layer from a given GeoJSON feature. Can use a custom pointToLayer and/or coordsToLatLng functions if provided as options.
coordsToLatLng(<Array> coords)	LatLng	Creates a LatLng object from an array of 2 numbers (longitude, latitude) or 3 numbers (longitude, latitude, altitude) used in GeoJSON for points.
coordsToLatLngs(<Array> coords, <Number> levelsDeep?, <Function> coordsToLatLng?)	Array	Creates a multidimensional array of LatLngs from a GeoJSON coordinates array. levelsDeep specifies the nesting level (0 is for an array of points, 1 for an array of arrays of points, etc., 0 by default). Can use a custom coordsToLatLng function.
latLngToCoords(<LatLng> latlng, <Number|false> precision?)	Array	Reverse of coordsToLatLng Coordinates values are rounded with formatNum function.
latLngsToCoords(<Array> latlngs, <Number> levelsDeep?, <Boolean> closed?, <Number|false> precision?)	Array	Reverse of coordsToLatLngs closed determines whether the first point should be appended to the end of the array to close the feature, only used when levelsDeep is 0. False by default. Coordinates values are rounded with formatNum function.
asFeature(<Object> geojson)	Object	Normalize GeoJSON geometries/features into GeoJSON features.
GridLayer
Generic class for handling a tiled grid of HTML elements. This is the base class for all tile layers and replaces TileLayer.Canvas. GridLayer can be extended to create a tiled grid of HTML elements like <canvas>, <img> or <div>. GridLayer will handle creating and animating these DOM elements for you.

Usage example
Synchronous usage
To create a custom layer, extend GridLayer and implement the createTile() method, which will be passed a Point object with the x, y, and z (zoom level) coordinates to draw your tile.

var CanvasLayer = L.GridLayer.extend({
    createTile: function(coords){
        // create a <canvas> element for drawing
        var tile = L.DomUtil.create('canvas', 'leaflet-tile');

        // setup tile width and height according to the options
        var size = this.getTileSize();
        tile.width = size.x;
        tile.height = size.y;

        // get a canvas context and draw something on it using coords.x, coords.y and coords.z
        var ctx = tile.getContext('2d');

        // return the tile so it can be rendered on screen
        return tile;
    }
});
Asynchronous usage
Tile creation can also be asynchronous, this is useful when using a third-party drawing library. Once the tile is finished drawing it can be passed to the done() callback.

var CanvasLayer = L.GridLayer.extend({
    createTile: function(coords, done){
        var error;

        // create a <canvas> element for drawing
        var tile = L.DomUtil.create('canvas', 'leaflet-tile');

        // setup tile width and height according to the options
        var size = this.getTileSize();
        tile.width = size.x;
        tile.height = size.y;

        // draw something asynchronously and pass the tile to the done() callback
        setTimeout(function() {
            done(error, tile);
        }, 1000);

        return tile;
    }
});
Creation
Factory	Description
L.gridLayer(<GridLayer options> options?)	Creates a new instance of GridLayer with the supplied options.
Options
Option	Type	Default	Description
tileSize	Number|Point	256	Width and height of tiles in the grid. Use a number if width and height are equal, or L.point(width, height) otherwise.
opacity	Number	1.0	Opacity of the tiles. Can be used in the createTile() function.
updateWhenIdle	Boolean	(depends)	Load new tiles only when panning ends. true by default on mobile browsers, in order to avoid too many requests and keep smooth navigation. false otherwise in order to display new tiles during panning, since it is easy to pan outside the keepBuffer option in desktop browsers.
updateWhenZooming	Boolean	true	By default, a smooth zoom animation (during a touch zoom or a flyTo()) will update grid layers every integer zoom level. Setting this option to false will update the grid layer only when the smooth animation ends.
updateInterval	Number	200	Tiles will not update more than once every updateInterval milliseconds when panning.
zIndex	Number	1	The explicit zIndex of the tile layer.
bounds	LatLngBounds	undefined	If set, tiles will only be loaded inside the set LatLngBounds.
minZoom	Number	0	The minimum zoom level down to which this layer will be displayed (inclusive).
maxZoom	Number	undefined	The maximum zoom level up to which this layer will be displayed (inclusive).
maxNativeZoom	Number	undefined	Maximum zoom number the tile source has available. If it is specified, the tiles on all zoom levels higher than maxNativeZoom will be loaded from maxNativeZoom level and auto-scaled.
minNativeZoom	Number	undefined	Minimum zoom number the tile source has available. If it is specified, the tiles on all zoom levels lower than minNativeZoom will be loaded from minNativeZoom level and auto-scaled.
noWrap	Boolean	false	Whether the layer is wrapped around the antimeridian. If true, the GridLayer will only be displayed once at low zoom levels. Has no effect when the map CRS doesn't wrap around. Can be used in combination with bounds to prevent requesting tiles outside the CRS limits.
pane	String	'tilePane'	Map pane where the grid layer will be added.
className	String	''	A custom class name to assign to the tile layer. Empty by default.
keepBuffer	Number	2	When panning the map, keep this many rows and columns of tiles before unloading them.

LatLng
Represents a geographical point with a certain latitude and longitude.

Usage example
var latlng = L.latLng(50.5, 30.5);
All Leaflet methods that accept LatLng objects also accept them in a simple Array form and simple object form (unless noted otherwise), so these lines are equivalent:

map.panTo([50, 30]);
map.panTo({lng: 30, lat: 50});
map.panTo({lat: 50, lng: 30});
map.panTo(L.latLng(50, 30));
Note that LatLng does not inherit from Leaflet's Class object, which means new classes can't inherit from it, and new methods can't be added to it with the include function.

Creation
Factory	Description
L.latLng(<Number> latitude, <Number> longitude, <Number> altitude?)	Creates an object representing a geographical point with the given latitude and longitude (and optionally altitude).
L.latLng(<Array> coords)	Expects an array of the form [Number, Number] or [Number, Number, Number] instead.
L.latLng(<Object> coords)	Expects an plain object of the form {lat: Number, lng: Number} or {lat: Number, lng: Number, alt: Number} instead.
Methods
Method	Returns	Description
equals(<LatLng> otherLatLng, <Number> maxMargin?)	Boolean	
Returns true if the given LatLng point is at the same position (within a small margin of error). The margin of error can be overridden by setting maxMargin to a small number.

toString()	String	
Returns a string representation of the point (for debugging purposes).

distanceTo(<LatLng> otherLatLng)	Number	
Returns the distance (in meters) to the given LatLng calculated using the Spherical Law of Cosines.

wrap()	LatLng	
Returns a new LatLng object with the longitude wrapped so it's always between -180 and +180 degrees.

toBounds(<Number> sizeInMeters)	LatLngBounds	
Returns a new LatLngBounds object in which each boundary is sizeInMeters/2 meters apart from the LatLng.

Properties
Property	Type	Description
lat	Number	Latitude in degrees
lng	Number	Longitude in degrees
alt	Number	Altitude in meters (optional)
LatLngBounds
Represents a rectangular geographical area on a map.

Usage example
var corner1 = L.latLng(40.712, -74.227),
corner2 = L.latLng(40.774, -74.125),
bounds = L.latLngBounds(corner1, corner2);
All Leaflet methods that accept LatLngBounds objects also accept them in a simple Array form (unless noted otherwise), so the bounds example above can be passed like this:

map.fitBounds([
    [40.712, -74.227],
    [40.774, -74.125]
]);
Caution: if the area crosses the antimeridian (often confused with the International Date Line), you must specify corners outside the [-180, 180] degrees longitude range.

Note that LatLngBounds does not inherit from Leaflet's Class object, which means new classes can't inherit from it, and new methods can't be added to it with the include function.

Creation
Factory	Description
L.latLngBounds(<LatLng> corner1, <LatLng> corner2)	Creates a LatLngBounds object by defining two diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle.
L.latLngBounds(<LatLng[]> latlngs)	Creates a LatLngBounds object defined by the geographical points it contains. Very useful for zooming the map to fit a particular set of locations with fitBounds.

Returns true if the rectangle overlaps the given bounds. Two bounds overlap if their intersection is an area.

toBBoxString()	String	
Returns a string with bounding box coordinates in a 'southwest_lng,southwest_lat,northeast_lng,northeast_lat' format. Useful for sending requests to web services that return geo data.

equals(<LatLngBounds> otherBounds, <Number> maxMargin?)	Boolean	
Returns true if the rectangle is equivalent (within a small margin of error) to the given bounds. The margin of error can be overridden by setting maxMargin to a small number.

isValid()	Boolean	
Returns true if the bounds are properly initialized.

Point
Represents a point with x and y coordinates in pixels.

Usage example
var point = L.point(200, 300);
All Leaflet methods and options that accept Point objects also accept them in a simple Array form (unless noted otherwise), so these lines are equivalent:

map.panBy([200, 300]);
map.panBy(L.point(200, 300));
Note that Point does not inherit from Leaflet's Class object, which means new classes can't inherit from it, and new methods can't be added to it with the include function.

Creation

Bounds
Represents a rectangular area in pixel coordinates.

Usage example
var p1 = L.point(10, 10),
p2 = L.point(40, 60),
bounds = L.bounds(p1, p2);
All Leaflet methods that accept Bounds objects also accept them in a simple Array form (unless noted otherwise), so the bounds example above can be passed like this:

otherBounds.intersects([[10, 10], [40, 60]]);
Note that Bounds does not inherit from Leaflet's Class object, which means new classes can't inherit from it, and new methods can't be added to it with the include function.

});
disableScrollPropagation(<HTMLElement> el)	this	Adds stopPropagation to the element's 'wheel' events (plus browser variants).
disableClickPropagation(<HTMLElement> el)	this	Adds stopPropagation to the element's 'click', 'dblclick', 'contextmenu', 'mousedown' and 'touchstart' events (plus browser variants).
preventDefault(<DOMEvent> ev)	this	Prevents the default action of the DOM Event ev from happening (such as following a link in the href of the a element, or doing a POST request with page reload when a <form> is submitted). Use it inside listener functions.
stop(<DOMEvent> ev)	this	Does stopPropagation and preventDefault at the same time.
getPropagationPath(<DOMEvent> ev)	Array	Compatibility polyfill for Event.composedPath(). Returns an array containing the HTMLElements that the given DOM event should propagate to (if not stopped).

‚ñ∂ Methods inherited from Evented
Class
L.Class powers the OOP facilities of Leaflet and is used to create almost all of the Leaflet classes documented here.

In addition to implementing a simple classical inheritance model, it introduces several special properties for convenient code organization ‚Äî options, includes and statics.

Usage example
var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
initialize: function (greeter) {
    this.greeter = greeter;
    // class constructor
},

greet: function (name) {
    alert(this.greeter + ', ' + name)
    }
});

// create instance of MyClass, passing "Hello" to the constructor
var a = new MyClass("Hello");

// call greet method, alerting "Hello, World"
a.greet("World");
Class Factories
You may have noticed that Leaflet objects are created without using the new keyword. This is achieved by complementing each class with a lowercase factory method:

new L.Map('map'); // becomes:
L.map('map');
The factories are implemented very easily, and you can do this for your own classes:

L.map = function (id, options) {
    return new L.Map(id, options);
};
Inheritance
You use L.Class.extend to define new classes, but you can use the same method on any class to inherit from it:

var MyChildClass = MyClass.extend({
    // ... new properties and methods
});
This will create a class that inherits all methods and properties of the parent class (through a proper prototype chain), adding or overriding the ones you pass to extend. It will also properly react to instanceof:

var a = new MyChildClass();
a instanceof MyChildClass; // true
a instanceof MyClass; // true
You can call parent methods (including constructor) from corresponding child ones (as you do with super calls in other languages) by accessing parent class prototype and using JavaScript's call or apply:

var MyChildClass = MyClass.extend({
    initialize: function () {
        MyClass.prototype.initialize.call(this, "Yo");
    },

    greet: function (name) {
        MyClass.prototype.greet.call(this, 'bro ' + name + '!');
    }
});

var a = new MyChildClass();
a.greet('Jason'); // alerts "Yo, bro Jason!"
Options
options is a special property that unlike other objects that you pass to extend will be merged with the parent one instead of overriding it completely, which makes managing configuration of objects and default values convenient:

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
    options: {
        myOption1: 'foo',
        myOption2: 'bar'
    }
});

var MyChildClass = MyClass.extend({
    options: {
        myOption1: 'baz',
        myOption3: 5
    }
});

var a = new MyChildClass();
a.options.myOption1; // 'baz'
a.options.myOption2; // 'bar'
a.options.myOption3; // 5
There's also L.Util.setOptions, a method for conveniently merging options passed to constructor with the defaults defines in the class:

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
    options: {
        foo: 'bar',
        bla: 5
    },

    initialize: function (options) {
        L.Util.setOptions(this, options);
        ...
    }
});

var a = new MyClass({bla: 10});
a.options; // {foo: 'bar', bla: 10}
Note that the options object allows any keys, not just the options defined by the class and its base classes. This means you can use the options object to store application specific information, as long as you avoid keys that are already used by the class in question.

Includes
includes is a special class property that merges all specified objects into the class (such objects are called mixins).

 var MyMixin = {
    foo: function () { ... },
    bar: 5
};

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
    includes: MyMixin
});

var a = new MyClass();
a.foo();
You can also do such includes in runtime with the include method:

MyClass.include(MyMixin);
statics is just a convenience property that injects specified object properties as the static properties of the class, useful for defining constants:

var MyClass = L.Class.extend({
    statics: {
        FOO: 'bar',
        BLA: 5
    }
});

MyClass.FOO; // 'bar'
Constructor hooks
If you're a plugin developer, you often need to add additional initialization code to existing classes (e.g. editing hooks for L.Polyline). Leaflet comes with a way to do it easily using the addInitHook method:

MyClass.addInitHook(function () {
    // ... do something in constructor additionally
    // e.g. add event listeners, set custom properties etc.
});
You can also use the following shortcut when you just need to make one additional method call:

MyClass.addInitHook('methodName', arg1, arg2, ‚Ä¶);
Functions
Function	Returns	Description
extend(<Object> props)	Function	Extends the current class given the properties to be included. Returns a Javascript function that is a class constructor (to be called with new).
include(<Object> properties)	this	Includes a mixin into the current class.
mergeOptions(<Object> options)	this	Merges options into the defaults of the class.
addInitHook(<Function> fn)	this	Adds a constructor hook to the class.
Evented
A set of methods shared between event-powered classes (like Map and Marker). Generally, events allow you to execute some function when something happens with an object (e.g. the user clicks on the map, causing the map to fire 'click' event).

Usage example
map.on('click', function(e) {
    alert(e.latlng);
} );
Leaflet deals with event listeners by reference, so if you want to add a listener and then remove it, define it as a function:

function onClick(e) { ... }

map.on('click', onClick);
map.off('click', onClick);
Methods
Method	Returns	Description
on(<String> type, <Function> fn, <Object> context?)	this	
Adds a listener function (fn) to a particular event type of the object. You can optionally specify the context of the listener (object the this keyword will point to). You can also pass several space-separated types (e.g. 'click dblclick').

on(<Object> eventMap)	this	
Adds a set of type/listener pairs, e.g. {click: onClick, mousemove: onMouseMove}

off(<String> type, <Function> fn?, <Object> context?)	this	
Removes a previously added listener function. If no function is specified, it will remove all the listeners of that particular event from the object. Note that if you passed a custom context to on, you must pass the same context to off in order to remove the listener.

off(<Object> eventMap)	this	
Removes a set of type/listener pairs.

off()	this	
Removes all listeners to all events on the object. This includes implicitly attached events.

fire(<String> type, <Object> data?, <Boolean> propagate?)	this	
Fires an event of the specified type. You can optionally provide a data object ‚Äî the first argument of the listener function will contain its properties. The event can optionally be propagated to event parents.

listens(<String> type, <Boolean> propagate?)	Boolean	
Returns true if a particular event type has any listeners attached to it. The verification can optionally be propagated, it will return true if parents have the listener attached to it.

once(‚Ä¶)	this	
Behaves as on(‚Ä¶), except the listener will only get fired once and then removed.

addEventParent(<Evented> obj)	this	
Adds an event parent - an Evented that will receive propagated events

removeEventParent(<Evented> obj)	this	
Removes an event parent, so it will stop receiving propagated events

addEventListener(‚Ä¶)	this	
Alias to on(‚Ä¶)

removeEventListener(‚Ä¶)	this	
Alias to off(‚Ä¶)

clearAllEventListeners(‚Ä¶)	this	
Alias to off()

addOneTimeEventListener(‚Ä¶)	this	
Alias to once(‚Ä¶)

fireEvent(‚Ä¶)	this	
Alias to fire(‚Ä¶)

hasEventListeners(‚Ä¶)	Boolean	
Alias to listens(‚Ä¶)

Projects geographical coordinates into a 2D point. Only accepts actual L.LatLng instances, not arrays.

unproject(<Point> point)	LatLng	
The inverse of project. Projects a 2D point into a geographical location. Only accepts actual L.Point instances, not arrays.

Note that the projection instances do not inherit from Leaflet's Class object, and can't be instantiated. Also, new classes can't inherit from them, and methods can't be added to them with the include function.

Properties
Property	Type	Description
bounds	Bounds	The bounds (specified in CRS units) where the projection is valid
Defined projections
Leaflet comes with a set of already defined Projections out of the box:
Projection	Description
L.Projection.LonLat	Equirectangular, or Plate Carree projection ‚Äî the most simple projection, mostly used by GIS enthusiasts. Directly maps x as longitude, and y as latitude. Also suitable for flat worlds, e.g. game maps. Used by the EPSG:4326 and Simple CRS.
L.Projection.Mercator	Elliptical Mercator projection ‚Äî more complex than Spherical Mercator. Assumes that Earth is an ellipsoid. Used by the EPSG:3395 CRS.
L.Projection.SphericalMercator	Spherical Mercator projection ‚Äî the most common projection for online maps, used by almost all free and commercial tile providers. Assumes that Earth is a sphere. Used by the EPSG:3857 CRS.
CRS
Methods
Method	Returns	Description
latLngToPoint(<LatLng> latlng, <Number> zoom)	Point	
Projects geographical coordinates into pixel coordinates for a given zoom.

pointToLatLng(<Point> point, <Number> zoom)	LatLng	
The inverse of latLngToPoint. Projects pixel coordinates on a given zoom into geographical coordinates.

project(<LatLng> latlng)	Point	
Projects geographical coordinates into coordinates in units accepted for this CRS (e.g. meters for EPSG:3857, for passing it to WMS services).

unproject(<Point> point)	LatLng	
Given a projected coordinate returns the corresponding LatLng. The inverse of project.

scale(<Number> zoom)	Number	
Returns the scale used when transforming projected coordinates into pixel coordinates for a particular zoom. For example, it returns 256 * 2^zoom for Mercator-based CRS.

zoom(<Number> scale)	Number	
Inverse of scale(), returns the zoom level corresponding to a scale factor of scale.

getProjectedBounds(<Number> zoom)	Bounds	
Returns the projection's bounds scaled and transformed for the provided zoom.

distance(<LatLng> latlng1, <LatLng> latlng2)	Number	
Returns the distance between two geographical coordinates.

wrapLatLng(<LatLng> latlng)	LatLng	
Returns a LatLng where lat and lng has been wrapped according to the CRS's wrapLat and wrapLng properties, if they are outside the CRS's bounds.

wrapLatLngBounds(<LatLngBounds> bounds)	LatLngBounds	
Returns a LatLngBounds with the same size as the given one, ensuring that its center is within the CRS's bounds. Only accepts actual L.LatLngBounds instances, not arrays.

Properties
Property	Type	Description
code	String	Standard code name of the CRS passed into WMS services (e.g. 'EPSG:3857')
wrapLng	Number[]	An array of two numbers defining whether the longitude (horizontal) coordinate axis wraps around a given range and how. Defaults to [-180, 180] in most geographical CRSs. If undefined, the longitude axis does not wrap around.
wrapLat	Number[]	Like wrapLng, but for the latitude (vertical) axis.
infinite	Boolean	If true, the coordinate space will be unbounded (infinite in both axes)
Defined CRSs
CRS	Description
L.CRS.Earth	Serves as the base for CRS that are global such that they cover the earth. Can only be used as the base for other CRS and cannot be used directly, since it does not have a code, projection or transformation. distance() returns meters.
L.CRS.EPSG3395	Rarely used by some commercial tile providers. Uses Elliptical Mercator projection.
L.CRS.EPSG3857	The most common CRS for online maps, used by almost all free and commercial tile providers. Uses Spherical Mercator projection. Set in by default in Map's crs option.
L.CRS.EPSG4326	A common CRS among GIS enthusiasts. Uses simple Equirectangular projection.
Leaflet 1.0.x complies with the TMS coordinate scheme for EPSG:4326, which is a breaking change from 0.7.x behaviour. If you are using a TileLayer with this CRS, ensure that there are two 256x256 pixel tiles covering the whole earth at zoom level zero, and that the tile coordinate origin is (-180,+90), or (-180,-90) for TileLayers with the tms option set.

L.CRS.Base	Object that defines coordinate reference systems for projecting geographical points into pixel (screen) coordinates and back (and to coordinates in other units for WMS services). See spatial reference system.
Leaflet defines the most usual CRSs by default. If you want to use a CRS not defined by default, take a look at the Proj4Leaflet plugin.

Note that the CRS instances do not inherit from Leaflet's Class object, and can't be instantiated. Also, new classes can't inherit from them, and methods can't be added to them with the include function.

L.CRS.Simple	A simple CRS that maps longitude and latitude into x and y directly. May be used for maps of flat surfaces (e.g. game maps). Note that the y axis should still be inverted (going from bottom to top). distance() returns simple euclidean distance.
Renderer
Base class for vector renderer implementations (SVG, Canvas). Handles the DOM container of the renderer, its bounds, and its zoom animation.

A Renderer works as an implicit layer group for all Paths - the renderer itself can be added or removed to the map. All paths use a renderer, which can be implicit (the map will decide the type of renderer and use it automatically) or explicit (using the renderer option of the path).

Do not use this class directly, use SVG and Canvas instead.

Options
Option	Type	Default	Description
padding	Number	0.1	How much to extend the clip area around the map view (relative to its size) e.g. 0.1 would be 10% of map view in each direction

Event objects
Whenever a class inheriting from Evented fires an event, a listener function will be called with an event argument, which is a plain object containing information about the event. For example:

map.on('click', function(ev) {
    alert(ev.latlng); // ev is an event object (MouseEvent in this case)
});
The information available depends on the event type:

Global Switches
Global switches are created for rare cases and generally make Leaflet to not detect a particular browser feature even if it's there. You need to set the switch as a global variable to true before including Leaflet on the page, like this:

<script>L_NO_TOUCH = true;</script>
<script src="leaflet.js"></script>
Switch	Description
L_NO_TOUCH	Forces Leaflet to not use touch events even if it detects them.
L_DISABLE_3D	Forces Leaflet to not use hardware-accelerated CSS 3D transforms for positioning (which may cause glitches in some rare environments) even if they're supported.
noConflict
This method restores the L global variable to the original value it had before Leaflet inclusion, and returns the real Leaflet namespace so you can put it elsewhere, like this:

<script src='libs/l.js'>
<!-- L points to some other library -->

<script src='leaflet.js'>
<!-- you include Leaflet, it replaces the L variable to Leaflet namespace -->

<script>
var Leaflet = L.noConflict();
// now L points to that other library again, and you can use Leaflet.Map etc.
</script>
version
A constant that represents the Leaflet version in use.

L.version; // contains "1.0.0" (or whatever version is currently in use)
